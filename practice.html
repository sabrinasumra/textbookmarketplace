	<h7>"Whenever you read a good book, somewhere in the world a door opens to allow in more light." – Vera Nazarian.</h7>
	<h7>
	Books are core to any university course; without them you probably will not get very far. Every year, thousands of final year students are left with huge textbooks that they wish to sell, whilst new students coming into university for the first time are looking to buy these same textbooks.
	Getting these textbooks from a departing third year student to a new first year student proves difficult but now with the introduction of the TEXTBOOK MARKETPLACE you can advertise and find an extensive range of used textbooks without the hassle of time-consuming independent search.
